An Econometric Analysis of various health indicators on diseases across all districts in India, performed in R.

This analysis was carried out through the Assignments 1, 2 and the Project of the Econometrics-1 course taken during my fourth semester, in the months of March and April of 2022.

# Data Preprocessing

A csv file containing most of the data was provided by the course instructor. We then had to create datasets for gdp, beds and tap using data from the internet from the links that were provided. Then we have added this data to the appended columns in the larger dataset.
As part of the project, we also found data on the internet for child marriage rates across various states of India, and the content of nitate in the water supply.
